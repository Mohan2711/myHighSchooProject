# myHighSchooProject

Developed by a trio of friends:)


Cricket is one of the most popular games not just in India but across the world. It is played between two teams consisting of a total of eleven players each. Watching others play cricket is as exciting as playing it. Its craze has increased in manifolds.

By this project, we wish to provide a digital platform for the game so that an individual can anytime he/she wishes to do so in his/her computer.

Scope of improvements: 1. Tournament and auctions can be implemented to make it more realistic

                       2. More graphics can be implemented to make it more artistic.
